	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of disinformation has led to a growing interest in leveraging artiﬁcial intelligence ({AI}) for detecting and combating this phenomenon. This article presents a thematic analysis of the potential beneﬁts of automated disinformation detection from the perspective of information sciences. The analysis covers a range of approaches, including fact checking, linguistic analysis, sentiment analysis, and the utilization of human-in-the-loop systems. Furthermore, the article explores how the combination of blockchain and {AI} technologies can be used to automate the process of disinformation detection. Ultimately, the article aims to consider the integration of {AI} into journalism and emphasizes the importance of ongoing collaboration between these ﬁelds to effectively combat the spread of disinformation. The article also addresses ethical considerations related to the use of {AI} in journalism, including concerns about privacy, transparency, and accountability.},
